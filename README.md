# Welcome to the Ex3_OOP wiki!

## This is a joint project in the framework of computer science studies.

The goal of the project is to create a game.

The game main idea is to move robots on the graph to collect fruits.

The game offers 24 levels. each level is a different graph, different number of robots and fruits .

The game can be automatic, meaning the user chooses the level number and the robots move because of algorithm.

the game can be manual, meaning the user chooses the level number and the robots first loction and moves them by his choise using te mouse.
On each fruit written his score.

On the top rigth corner shows the score, the remaining time to play and the level played.

on the lower corner shows the robots id, value, src, dest and speed.
